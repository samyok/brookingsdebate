        I competed in Lincoln Douglas for the majority of my highschool career, where I was a state finalist this year and a national qualifier for the past three years. 
        Keeping debate going in South Dakota is very important to me, as this event completely shaped who I am as well as introduced me to some amazing people. 
        I can’t wait to get to know all you future LD’ers!`,

        I graduated from Sioux Falls Washington in 2021 and will be attending Harvard in the fall. 
        I competed in Lincoln-Douglas for four years, where I was a national runner-up, 2-time state champion, and 3-time national elimination round qualifier.

        Outside of debate, I love fishing with Elijah, playing soccer and tennis, cooking/eating, and hanging out with the others in the debate community!`,

        I will be at Macalester College in St. Paul this fall, majoring in education and perhaps English. Debate taught me to be confident in my voice and who I am, and I’ve made so many friends through the activity.
