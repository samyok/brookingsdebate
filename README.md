# Dakota Debate Institute
Welcome to the repository for DDI! In 2021, we're going completely online. 

This repository is coded in Next.js with Typescript and some SASS deployed on Vercel.

Dakota Debate Institute is the successor to Brookings High School's 2020 Online Debate Camp. I am the only coder on the team, so I handle everything from UX to authentication and the backend to the Discord bot integrations. There's a lot of moving parts, and you can find them all in the various branches of this repo :)
